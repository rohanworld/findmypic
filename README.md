FindMyPic - An Intelligent Local Image Search Tool
Overview
FindMyPic is an advanced Local Image Search Tool that leverages vector embeddings and ChromaDB to enable efficient image retrieval based on natural language descriptions. 
This project uses OpenCLIP to generate vector embeddings, ensuring that all image data remains securely on the user's local drive without requiring cloud access.

Features
Natural Language Search: Search for images using simple descriptions (e.g., "man in blue shirt", "selfie with benz car").
Data Privacy: Images remain on your local drive, ensuring complete privacy.
Efficient Retrieval: Uses ChromaDB for fast and accurate image retrieval.
